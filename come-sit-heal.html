        A movement of love, resilience, and healing<br>
At the heart of Come • Sit • Heal are 16 extraordinary rescue dogs who survived abuse, neglect, and abandonment. Many now roll through life in wheelchairs, walk on prosthetic legs, or live with visible differences—but they radiate joy, strength, and unconditional love.
These Unstoppable Dogs are not defined by what they lost, but by what they give. Each one carries a story of second chances and now serves as a therapy and ambassador animal, bringing healing to children, adults, veterans, and entire communities.
When you invite Come • Sit • Heal into your school, workplace, or organization, you invite:<br>
        <ul>
   <b>Inspiration</b> — Stories of survival that ignite hope and remind us never to give up.
   <b>Connection</b> — A chance to sit, breathe, and share space with therapy dogs whose presence lowers stress and opens hearts.
   <b>Transformation</b> — Real lessons in compassion, empathy, resilience, and inclusion delivered not through lectures, but through love.
        </ul>
This program isn’t just about meeting dogs. It’s about rediscovering the power of second chances, the beauty of differences, and the truth that healing is always possible.
Come • Sit • Heal is more than therapy, it’s a movement proving that love can turn scars into strength, and that no obstacle is greater than the will to rise.
